a) Copyright Registration Tracking
Store and track copyright registration details for different works.
Include information like creator's details, work description, registration date, and registration number.
b) Legal Documents Repository
Allow users to upload and securely store legal documents such as registration certificates, contracts, licenses, etc.
c) Trademark & Patent Management
Implement features for managing trademarks and patents.
Track important dates such as renewal deadlines and application status.
d) Content Usage & Licensing
Manage licenses for copyrighted works, including licensing terms and conditions.
Allow users to track usage of their content (e.g., who licensed the work, when, and for how long).
e) Copyright Infringement Reports
Enable users to report copyright infringement cases.
Keep track of the legal status of each case and offer direct access to legal counsel.
3. Integration with Other Tools
EHR (Electronic Health Records) for healthcare: Integrate with EHR systems to import/export patient data.
Legal APIs: Integrate with services like Copyright.gov, USPTO (for trademarks and patents), or LegalZoom for automatic copyright registration tracking.
4. Enhanced Dashboard
Dynamic Dashboards: Display patient data or copyright statuses in a graphical, easy-to-read format.
For patients: Appointment stats, active conditions, recent visits, and upcoming prescriptions.
For copyrights: Recent filings, active licenses, and infringement cases.
Alerts & Notifications: Alert users about important dates, upcoming appointments, and document expiry (e.g., patents or licenses).
5. Reports & Analytics
Exportable Reports: Generate reports for legal cases or medical records (PDF, CSV).
Analytics: Provide insight into patient visits, case outcomes, or copyright usage statistics.
6. Secure Communication & Video Calls
For healthcare, implement a telemedicine feature to allow video consultations.
For legal cases, integrate secure messaging between clients and legal teams.
7. Consent Management (Healthcare & Legal)

Allow users to digitally sign and store these consent forms.
8. Role-Based Access Control
Allow different roles (doctor, lawyer, patient, legal assistant) with role-specific permissions to access or modify the data.
For example, in healthcare, a doctor can update patient info, but only administrators can delete records.
9. Integration with Cloud Storage (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox)
Allow users to sync their documents and back up data to cloud storage for easy access and sharing.
10. Advanced Search and Filters
Allow users to search by multiple criteria (e.g., patient name, diagnosis, registration number, status, etc.).
Enable advanced filtering options to refine search results.
